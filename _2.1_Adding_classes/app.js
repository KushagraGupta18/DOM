let h1=document.querySelector('h1');
//i can gave multiple classes by giving space between them
h1.setAttribute('class','sam sam1');
// h1.setAttribute('class','sam', 'sam1');//wrong way(we can't do like this because we have to write all classes to add single classes)
//we have to add all classes seperately in our code this is not the right way
